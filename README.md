SWAPI GraphQL Wrapper
=====================

A wrapper around [SWAPI](http://swapi.tech) built using GraphQL converting it into [this schema](schema.graphql).

Uses:

* [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) - a JavaScript GraphQL runtime.
* [DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) - for coalescing and caching fetches.
* [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql) - to provide HTTP access to GraphQL.
* [aws-serverless-express](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-express) - to use `express-graphql` on aws lambda.
* [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) - for easy exploration of this GraphQL server.
